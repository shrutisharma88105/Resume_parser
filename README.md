# Resume_parser
This project aims to develop a tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from resumes in various formats such as .doc, .docx, .pdf, etc., using Python. The extracted information can then be used for various purposes such as parsing resumes for job applications, building candidate databases, or extracting insights.
